# Distributed Non Linear Semiparametric SVM training in Spark 

This is an example to run the code used in the paper:

"Distributed Non-Linear Semiparametric Support Vector Machine for Big Data Applications on Spark"

Submitted to the journal:

"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems"

This library can be used to train a Distributed Semiparametric SVM:

 - Making use of a distributed and stochastic version of the Sparse Greedy Matrix Approximation algorithm (called DSSGMA) to obtain the elements of the semiparametric model.
 - Using a distributed version of the Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares procedure to obtain the weights of the semiparametric model.

To see a demo you can run the jupyter notebook file that runs the algorithm on the adult dataset.
